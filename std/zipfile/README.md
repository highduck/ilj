# zipfile

Extract and create zip files for NodeJS and Browser

## Implementation

This is TypeScript port of beautiful JavaScript library [adm-zip](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip)

- Inflate / Deflate methods has been replaced with pure JavaScript implementation via `pako` package
- NodeJS Buffer functionality also replaced pure implementation
